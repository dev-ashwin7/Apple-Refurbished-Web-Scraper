# Apple-Refurbished-Web-Scraper
This web scraper scrapes Apple's refurbished website and notifies the user when the product they want comes into stock so that they can buy it quickly before it goes out of stock again. Since refurbished Apple products sell out rapidly, this scraper helps you stay on top of it - notifying you the exact minute it becomes available.

This project is a python web-scraper that scrapes the Apple Refurbished Website; this website containg refurbished, apple certified products that are heavily discounted. As a result of the increased affordability of these apple products, they sell out at lightning speed. To combat this, my python web-scraper runs in the background in the command prompt throughout the day. It checks the availability of the good you requested every minute - the moment it comes into stock, it notifies you of the price, the amount saved and the link where you can buy said product. If the product you requested is already available, it sends you a link to purchase it immediately. This program is extremely useful as it helps users stay on top of the apple refurbished website without having to constantly check the website manually and search for the product each time. Instead, just run the program once, enter the product you want and let the program run in the background, doing all the labour for you, until your requested product is back in stock.

To get started, install all the python libraries used using:

pip install bs4
pip install requests

Then, just run the python code in your terminal and enter the necessary information and let it run in the background while you carry on with other work.
