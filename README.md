# Apple-Refurbished-Web-Scraper
This web scraper scrapes Apple's refurbished website and notifies the user when the product they want comes into stock so that they can buy it quickly before it goes out of stock again. Since refurbished Apple products sell out rapidly, this scraper helps you stay on top of it - notifying you the exact minute it becomes available.

### Summary
The website scraped for this project is the Apple Refurbished Website, which sells deeply discounted, refurbished, Apple Certified products. These Apple products are more affordable than ever before, which is why they sell out so quickly. To counter this, I leave my Python web-scraper running continuously in the command prompt's background. Every minute, it checks to see if the item you asked for is still available; when it is, it notifies you with the price, the savings, and a link to the product's online store. It sends you a link to buy the item right away if the one you want is already in stock.This tool is quite helpful since it saves customers the time and effort of having to manually check the Apple Refurbished website constantly to check if the product they want has come into stock. Instead, simply launch the application once, enter the product you want, and then sit back and relax as the program works away in the background until your desired item returns to stock.
